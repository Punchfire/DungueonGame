# DungueonGame

This is a labyrinth game implemented with C++, where you need to collect a treasure in order to continue to the next level, _**But be careful**_ if any of the enemies touches you, you will lose.

> I made this project to understand and put into practice all the knowledge learned in Platzi's course "Practical course of C++"

## Features
- Three different levels.
- One treasure for level.
- Three lives per game.
- One enemy type, the "_**bat**_", that moves following a square path every time the player moves following. 
- You will lose lives if any enemy touches you.
- If you have the expertise to collect all the 3 treasures, you win!

## I hope you enjoy this small project ðŸ˜„
